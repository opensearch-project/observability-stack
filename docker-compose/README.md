# ATLAS Docker Compose Deployment

This directory contains the Docker Compose configuration for running the ATLAS observability stack locally.

## Directory Structure

```

├── docker-compose.yml              # Main orchestration file - defines all services
├── .env                            # Environment variables (versions, ports, credentials)

    └── opensearch_dashboards.yml
```

The main `docker-compose.yml` file is located in this directory and references configuration files from the subdirectories. Each service has its own subdirectory containing its specific configuration files. OpenSearch uses default configuration with environment variables set in docker-compose.yml.

## Quick Start

**Note**: The `.env` file contains all configurable parameters including component versions, ports, credentials, and resource limits. You can customize these values before starting the stack.

1. **Start the stack:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Verify services are running:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```

3. **Access the UIs:**
   - OpenSearch Dashboards: http://localhost:5601
   - Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
   - OpenSearch API: http://localhost:9200

4. **Send test data:**
   Configure your agent application to send OTLP data to:
   - gRPC: `http://localhost:4317`
   - HTTP: `http://localhost:4318`

5. **Stop the stack:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

6. **Stop and remove data:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down -v
   ```

## Services

- **otel-collector**: Receives OTLP telemetry data (ports 4317, 4318, 8888)
- **data-prepper**: Processes logs and traces before OpenSearch ingestion (ports 21890, 21892)
- **opensearch**: Stores logs and traces with security enabled (port 9200, 9600)
  - Default credentials: admin/My_password_123!@# (configured in .env file)
- **prometheus**: Stores metrics with OTLP receiver enabled (port 9090)
- **opensearch-dashboards**: Visualization UI (port 5601)

## Configuration Files

All configuration files are organized by service in subdirectories:

- **.env**: Environment variables for versions, ports, credentials, and resource limits
- **docker-compose.yml**: Main service definitions and orchestration (in this directory)
- **otel-collector/config.yaml**: OpenTelemetry Collector receivers, processors, and exporters
- **data-prepper/pipelines.yaml**: Data transformation pipelines for logs and traces
- **data-prepper/data-prepper-config.yaml**: Data Prepper server settings
- **prometheus/prometheus.yml**: Prometheus scrape targets and storage configuration
- **opensearch-dashboards/opensearch_dashboards.yml**: Dashboard UI settings

OpenSearch uses default configuration with settings provided via environment variables in docker-compose.yml.

### Customizing Configuration

**To change versions, ports, or credentials**: Edit the `.env` file and restart services:
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

**To modify service behavior**: Edit the configuration file in its respective subdirectory and restart the service:
```bash
docker-compose restart <service-name>
```

The docker-compose.yml file mounts these configurations into the containers.

## Data Retention

- **Logs and Traces**: Managed by OpenSearch index lifecycle policies (default: unlimited in development)
- **Metrics**: 15 days (configured in Prometheus)

Adjust retention periods by modifying the respective configuration files or OpenSearch index settings.

## Resource Requirements

**Minimum:**
- 4GB RAM
- 10GB disk space

**Recommended:**
- 8GB RAM
- 20GB disk space

## Troubleshooting

**Services won't start:**
```bash
docker-compose logs <service-name>
```

**Check OpenSearch health:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health?pretty
```

**Check if data is being ingested:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v
```

**Reset everything:**
```bash
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
```

## Security Warning

⚠️ **This configuration is for development only!**

Security considerations:
- OpenSearch has security enabled with default credentials (admin/admin)
- SSL certificate verification is disabled for development ease
- Permissive CORS settings
- No network isolation between services

For production use:
- Change default passwords
- Enable proper SSL/TLS with valid certificates
- Configure proper authentication and authorization
- Implement network policies
- Review and harden all security settings

Never use this configuration in production without proper hardening.

## Next Steps

- See the main README.md for instrumentation examples
- Check the examples/ directory for code samples
- Visit OpenSearch Dashboards to create visualizations
- Configure your agent applications to send OTLP data
