# 🌐 ATLAS - Agent Tracing Logging Analytics Stack

ATLAS (Agent Tracing Logging Analytics Stack) is an open-source quickstart observability stack specifically designed for AI agent observability. It provides a complete, pre-configured infrastructure that enables developers to quickly deploy and monitor their agent applications using industry-standard observability tools.

## Overview

ATLAS combines OpenSearch, OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, and OpenSearch Dashboards into a unified stack that ingests, processes, stores, and visualizes telemetry data from AI agents. The stack follows the [OpenTelemetry Gen-AI Semantic Conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/) to provide standardized observability for agent operations, tool executions, and evaluations.

### Components

- **OpenTelemetry Collector**: Receives OTLP data and routes it to appropriate backends
- **Data Prepper**: Transforms and enriches logs and traces before storage
- **OpenSearch**: Stores and indexes logs and traces for search and analysis
- **Prometheus**: Stores time-series metrics data
- **OpenSearch Dashboards**: Provides web-based visualization and exploration

## 🚀 Quickstart
To get started quickly, use the provided Docker Compose setup:

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/opensearch-project/atlas.git
cd atlas
```
### **Optional**: Configure stack
See [Configuration](#configuration) section for details on customizing the stack.

### 2️⃣ Start the stack:  
If you already have an agent to test with and want to send telemetry from your agent:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
Or if you don't have an agent to test with, you can start the stack with the included example services to generate example telemetry data.  
```bash
docker compose --profile examples up -d
```  
[docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) uses Docker [Profiles](https://docs.docker.com/reference/compose-file/profiles/) to specify optional run configurations. The above command uses the `examples` profile to start the stack with a sample agent and synthetic canary traffic

### 3️⃣ View your Logs and Traces in OpenSearch Dashboards 
👉 Navigate to http://localhost:5601  

Also, the `opensearch-dashboards-init` container will create initial Workspace and index patterns. It will also output the full dashboards URL with configured user/pass. Example:  

```bash
docker compose logs opensearch-dashboards-init --tail=20
```
Example output: 
```bash
...
opensearch-dashboards-init |🎉 ATLAS Stack Ready!
opensearch-dashboards-init |👤 Username: admin
opensearch-dashboards-init |🔑 Password: My_password_123!@#
opensearch-dashboards-init |📊 OpenSearch Dashboards Workspace: http://localhost:5601/w/9Z8lc3/app/explore/traces
```

### Destroying the Stack

To stop the stack (all profiles) while preserving your data:
```bash
docker compose --profile "*" down
```

To stop the stack and remove all data volumes:
```bash
docker compose --profile "*" down -v
```

## Instrumenting Your Agent

ATLAS accepts telemetry data via the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) and follows the [OpenTelemetry Gen-AI Semantic Conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/) for standardized attribute naming and structure for AI agents. 

### Example: Manual Instrumentation with OpenTelemetry  
For complete example, see [examples/plain-agents/weather-agent](./examples/plain-agents/weather-agent)  
```python
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor

# Configure OTLP exporter
tracer_provider = TracerProvider()
otlp_exporter = OTLPSpanExporter(endpoint="http://localhost:4317", insecure=True)
tracer_provider.add_span_processor(BatchSpanProcessor(otlp_exporter))
trace.set_tracer_provider(tracer_provider)

# Create tracer
tracer = trace.get_tracer("my-agent")

# Instrument agent invocation
with tracer.start_as_current_span("invoke_agent") as span:
    span.set_attribute("gen_ai.operation.name", "invoke_agent")
    span.set_attribute("gen_ai.agent.name", "Weather Assistant")
    span.set_attribute("gen_ai.request.model", "gpt-4")
    
    # Your agent logic here
    result = agent.run("What's the weather in Paris?")
    
    span.set_attribute("gen_ai.usage.input_tokens", 150)
    span.set_attribute("gen_ai.usage.output_tokens", 75)
```
### Example: Instrument with StrandsTelemetry
For complete example, see [examples/strands-agents/code-assistant](./examples/strands-agents/code-assistant)  
```python
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor
from strands import Agent
from strands.models import BedrockModel
from strands.telemetry import StrandsTelemetry

# 1. Initialize StrandsTelemetry (auto-instruments with GenAI semantic conventions)
telemetry = StrandsTelemetry()

# 2. Configure OTLP exporter to send traces to your observability stack
exporter = OTLPSpanExporter(endpoint="localhost:4317", insecure=True)
telemetry.tracer_provider.add_span_processor(BatchSpanProcessor(exporter))

# 3. Use your agent normally - telemetry happens automatically!
agent = Agent(
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant",
    model=BedrockModel(model_id="us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0"),
    tools=[your_tools]
)

# Every agent call is automatically traced with GenAI semantic conventions
agent("What's the weather like?")
```


## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The [.env](./.env) file contains all configurable parameters. Edit this file before starting the stack to customize your deployment.

### Changing OpenSearch Credentials

To change the OpenSearch username and password:

1. **Edit `.env` file**:
   ```env
   OPENSEARCH_USER=your-new-username
   OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD=your-new-password
   ```

2. **Update [Data Prepper configuration](docker-compose/data-prepper/pipelines.yaml)**:
   
   The Data Prepper configuration has hardcoded credentials in three OpenSearch sink definitions. You can update them automatically:
   
   ```bash
   # Replace username (default: admin)
   sed -i.bak 's/username: admin/username: your-new-username/g' docker-compose/data-prepper/pipelines.yaml
   
   # Replace password (default: My_password_123!@#)
   sed -i.bak 's/password: "My_password_123!@#"/password: "your-new-password"/g' docker-compose/data-prepper/pipelines.yaml
   ```
   
   Or manually update the `username` and `password` fields in all `opensearch:` sink sections.

3. **Restart the stack**:
   ```bash
   docker compose --profile "*" down
   docker compose up -d
   ```

**Note**: The `opensearch-dashboards` and `opensearch-dashboards-init` services automatically use the values from `.env`, so no manual changes are needed for those components.

## Production Readiness

⚠️ **ATLAS is NOT production-ready out of the box.** The default configuration prioritizes ease of use for development and testing. Before deploying to production, you must address the following:

### Security Hardening Required

- **Authentication**: Enable OpenSearch security plugin and configure user authentication
- **Authorization**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Encryption**: Enable TLS/SSL for all HTTP endpoints and encrypt data at rest
- **Network Security**: Implement network policies, firewalls, and limit exposed ports
- **Secrets Management**: Use secure secret storage instead of default passwords

### Operational Requirements

- **High Availability**: Configure multi-node OpenSearch cluster and redundant services
- **Backup and Recovery**: Implement automated backup procedures and test recovery
- **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring and alerting for the observability stack itself
- **Resource Limits**: Configure appropriate CPU, memory, and disk quotas
- **Data Lifecycle**: Implement production-appropriate retention and archival policies

### Security Considerations

The default configuration includes these development-friendly settings that are **NOT secure**:

- OpenSearch security plugin is disabled (no authentication required)
- No TLS/SSL encryption
- Default passwords where required
- Permissive CORS settings
- All services exposed without network isolation

**Never deploy the default configuration to production or expose it to untrusted networks.**

## Troubleshooting

### Services Won't Start

Check Docker resource allocation:
```bash
docker stats
```

View service logs:
```bash
docker compose logs <service-name>
```

### Data Not Appearing

Verify OpenTelemetry Collector is receiving data:
```bash
docker compose logs otel-collector
```

Check Data Prepper pipeline status:
```bash
docker compose logs data-prepper
```

Verify OpenSearch indices:
```bash
curl http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v
```

### Performance Issues

Check resource usage:
```bash
docker compose stats
```

Adjust resource limits in docker-compose.yml or values.yaml for Helm.

### Network Removal Error on Shutdown

If `docker compose down` fails with an error like:
```
failed to remove network atlas-network: Error response from daemon: error while removing network: network atlas-network id ab129adaabcd7ab35cddb1fbe8dc2a68b3c730b9fb9384c5c1e7f5ca015c27d9 has active endpoints
```

This typically occurs when you started services with a profile. Use:
```bash
docker compose --profile "*" down
```
