## Code of Conduct

This project follows the OpenSearch Project Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the project maintainers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker Engine 20.10+
- Docker Compose 2.0+
- Git
- Python 3.8+ (for testing and examples)
- kubectl and Helm 3.8+ (for Kubernetes contributions)

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/observability-stack.git
cd observability-stack
```

3. Add the upstream repository:
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/opensearch-project/observability-stack.git
```

4. Create a branch for your changes:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Make Your Changes

- Edit configuration files, documentation, or examples
- Follow the repository's naming conventions (kebab-case)
- Add inline comments to explain configuration settings
- Keep changes focused and atomic

### 2. Test Locally

#### Docker Compose Testing

```bash
# Start the stack
cd docker-compose
docker compose up -d

# Verify all services are running
docker-compose ps

# Check logs for errors
docker-compose logs

# Send test data
python ../examples/python/sample_agent.py

# Verify data in OpenSearch
curl http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v

# Stop the stack
docker-compose down
```

#### Helm Chart Testing

```bash
# Validate chart syntax
helm lint helm/observability-stack

# Render templates to check for errors
helm template observability-stack helm/observability-stack

# Deploy to a test cluster (kind, minikube, etc.)
helm install observability-stack-test helm/observability-stack

# Verify deployment
kubectl get pods
kubectl logs <pod-name>

# Clean up
helm uninstall observability-stack-test
```

### 3. Run Validation Tests

```bash
# Run configuration validation tests
pytest tests/

# Run YAML linters
yamllint docker-compose/
yamllint helm/

# Run markdown linters
markdownlint *.md docs/*.md
```

### 4. Update Documentation

- Update README.md if you've changed functionality or configuration
- Update AGENTS.md if you've changed repository structure
- Add or update examples if you've added new features
- Include inline comments in configuration files

### 5. Commit Your Changes

git commit -m "feat(otel-collector): add support for additional OTLP endpoints"
git commit -m "docs(readme): update quick start instructions"
git commit -m "config(prometheus): increase retention to 30 days"
git commit -m "fix(docker-compose): correct service dependency order"
```

### 6. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a pull request on GitHub with:
- Clear title describing the change
- Detailed description of what changed and why
- Reference to any related issues
- Screenshots or logs if applicable

## Testing Requirements

### Configuration Validation

All configuration changes must pass validation tests:

```bash
pytest tests/test_docker_compose_config.py
pytest tests/test_otel_collector_config.py
pytest tests/test_data_prepper_config.py
pytest tests/test_helm_charts.py
```

### Integration Testing

For significant changes, run integration tests:

```bash
# Docker Compose integration test
./scripts/integration-test-docker.sh

# Helm integration test (requires Kubernetes cluster)
./scripts/integration-test-helm.sh
```

### Example Code Testing

If you add or modify examples:

```bash
# Test Python examples
cd examples/python
python -m pytest

# Test JavaScript examples
cd examples/javascript
npm test
```

## Code Style Guidelines

### YAML Configuration Files

- **Indentation**: Use 2 spaces (no tabs)
- **Comments**: Include inline comments explaining key settings
- **Ordering**: Group related settings together
- **Quotes**: Use quotes for strings containing special characters
- **Line Length**: Keep lines under 100 characters when possible

**Example**:
```yaml
# OpenTelemetry Collector configuration
receivers:
  # OTLP receiver accepts telemetry data via OpenTelemetry Protocol
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317  # Standard OTLP gRPC port
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318  # Standard OTLP HTTP port
```

### Docker Compose Files

- Use specific image versions (not `latest`)
- Declare service dependencies explicitly
- Use named volumes for persistence
- Include health checks where applicable
- Document exposed ports

**Example**:
```yaml
opensearch:
  image: opensearchproject/opensearch:2.11.0
  container_name: opensearch
  environment:
    - discovery.type=single-node
    - OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx512m
  ports:
    - "9200:9200"
  volumes:
    - opensearch-data:/usr/share/opensearch/data
  networks:
    - observability-stack-network
```

### Helm Charts

- Follow Helm best practices
- Use `values.yaml` for all configurable parameters
- Include helpful comments in templates
- Provide sensible defaults
- Document all values in comments

### Python Code

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Include docstrings for functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and small

### JavaScript/TypeScript Code

- Follow Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide
- Use ES6+ features
- Include JSDoc comments
- Use TypeScript for type safety when possible

### Documentation

- Use Markdown for all documentation
- Include code examples with syntax highlighting
- Provide both quick start and detailed explanations
- Keep language clear and concise
- Use proper heading hierarchy

## AI Agent Contributions

AI coding assistants are welcome to contribute! When contributing as an AI agent:

### Best Practices

1. **Read AGENTS.md First**: Understand repository structure and conventions
2. **Follow Patterns**: Use existing code as templates for new contributions
3. **Include Context**: Provide clear commit messages and PR descriptions
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Run all validation tests before submitting
5. **Document Changes**: Update relevant documentation files
6. **Ask Questions**: If uncertain, ask for clarification in the PR

### Common AI Contribution Areas

- Adding new language examples
- Improving documentation clarity
- Adding inline comments to configurations
- Creating new dashboard templates
- Writing validation tests
- Fixing typos and formatting issues

### AI-Specific Guidelines

- Always validate generated YAML syntax
- Test generated code examples before submitting
- Ensure generated documentation is accurate
- Follow existing patterns rather than inventing new ones
- Include references to source documentation when applicable

## Documentation Guidelines

### README.md

- Keep quick start section concise
- Include architecture diagrams
- Provide troubleshooting guidance
- Maintain production readiness warnings
- Update when adding new features

### AGENTS.md

- Explain repository structure clearly
- Document naming conventions
- Provide common task examples
- Include configuration patterns
- Keep AI-assistant focused

### Code Comments

- Explain *why*, not just *what*
- Document security implications
- Note performance considerations
- Reference relevant specifications
- Keep comments up to date
- Avoid narrative prose and internal team voice (e.g., "we deliberately...") — comments are for future maintainers, not decision history

### Examples

- Include complete, runnable code
- Add README.md in example directories
- Show both basic and advanced usage
- Follow language-specific conventions
- Test examples before committing

### Writing Tenets (for agents)

Applies to all user-facing documentation: READMEs, public docs under `docs/`, migration guides, and PR descriptions.

**Framing**

- No us-vs-them. Write "Point your agents at observability-stack," not "at us." In open-source projects, the reader is part of the same community.
- Don't leak internal conversation into docs. Design-doc voice ("this is the canonical case where...", "we deliberately omitted...") belongs in PR discussion or design documents, not user-facing artifacts.
- Factual, not promotional. Avoid marketing phrases like "does ONE thing," "zero drift risk," or "honest limits."
- Acknowledge nuance via asides (`:::note` in Starlight docs) or italic notes, not prose digressions.

**Maintenance hygiene**

- Don't pin version strings. Link to `main` of upstream repos (e.g., `opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/...`), not to a specific tag. Version pins go stale.
- Don't duplicate source code in docs. Config YAML, pipeline definitions, and translation tables drift from the real source. Link to the source file instead.
- Don't maintain per-vendor translation tables beyond 3–5 canonical well-known fields. Defer to upstream receiver READMEs and vendor documentation. Positioning this repo as a schema authority creates permanent maintenance burden.
- Repo READMEs should link to public docs, not duplicate them. One source of truth per content type.

**Accuracy**

- Verify specific claims before writing them. Dates, version numbers, protocol behavior, UI terminology — check primary sources.
- If a claim cannot be verified from primary sources, phrase it more vaguely. "Modern versions support X" beats "as of v1.42, X is supported" when the version claim is unverified.
- Check existing conventions. Before using a UI name or terminology, grep the rest of the docs to see what other pages call it.
- Run the documentation build (`npm run build` in `docs/starlight-docs`) before committing doc changes. Verify internal links are valid.

**Public-doc page structure**

Pages for users migrating TO observability-stack should cover, in order:

1. Action-oriented lead (one sentence — what the reader can do)
2. Decision table when multiple paths exist ("Do I need this?" / "Which path applies?")
3. Configuration — concrete environment variables, example config, code snippet per path
4. Verify step — one-command check that it's working
5. What lands in OpenSearch — concrete example of end state (field names, index patterns)
6. Caveats — real observed gotchas surfaced from validation, not theoretical ones
7. Not covered — honest scope boundaries
8. References — upstream sources, vendor docs

**Repo READMEs** are for contributors, not migrators. Keep them short (20–40 lines for leaf READMEs; 100 max for overview). Link out to public docs for user-facing content. Include repo-local context only: config file paths, upstream receiver links, local dev workflow commands.

**Caveats from real validation are more trustworthy than theoretical ones.** When end-to-end testing reveals a gotcha (e.g., an attribute gets overwritten, a field doesn't translate), document it in the caveats section. Lead with what the user will see, not why it happens.

**Scope discipline**

- Prune aggressively when in doubt. Deletion is cheaper than maintenance.
- Don't commit working files — audit tables, compatibility matrices, session notes, TODO lists, WIP drafts. If it's not useful to a future reader with no context, it's not a docs artifact.
